# tcpgrep
we developed a command line tool called "tcpgrep" that can be used to filter the TCP traffic.It can be used to filter traffic based on a variety of criteria, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.This command line tool helps the user to get the required information on the TCP packets by using the following options. The command is : tcpgrep and the options are :
tcpgrep

o For displaying help option , tcpgrep pcapfilename

o To display the total number of tcp packets, tcpgrep pcapfile name -t

o To display the total number of incomplete tcpsession, tcpgrep pcapfile name -i

o To display the incomplete tcpsessions with packet numbers, tcpgrep pcapfile name -in

o To display the total number of rst packets, tcpgrep -r

o To display the total rst packets with packet number, tcpgrep pcapfile name -rn

o To display the total number of duplicate ack packets, tcpgrep pcapfile name -a

o To display the total number of duplicate ack packets with packet number, tcpgrep pcapfile name -an

o To dump specific range of tcp packet, tcpgrep pcapfile name -p packet range start â€“ end range example: tcpgrep pcap1.pcap -p 2-10

o To dump specific range of ports, tcpgrep pcapfile name -p: ip address:port no

    example: tcpgrep pcap1.pcap -p 192.168.4.5:443

o To dump specified tcpflags, tcpgrep pcapfile name -pflags: A,P,F,U,S,R example : tcpgrep pcap1.pcap -pA ,-pF,-pS,-pU,-pR,-pP
